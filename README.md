Overview

Pumpsploit is a Node.js command line interface designed to support memecoin trading on Solana. It acts as a unified toolset for interacting with multiple Solana dexes and data providers. The project emphasizes speed, reliability, and clear workflows for automated or manual trading strategies. It is built to work with a variety of data feeds and on-chain programs that power memecoin markets on Solana.

The goal is to give traders a solid, scriptable base to execute orders quickly across DEXes, while keeping the surface area minimal and predictable. The tool integrates with popular Solana data and wallet providers and can be extended with community plugins and scripts. It is designed for developers, traders, and operators who want a consistent CLI experience when exploring memecoin liquidity and arbitrage opportunities.

The project namespace blends memecoin culture with solid engineering. It uses a modular approach so new dex adapters, data sources, or strategies can be added without rewriting core logic. The CLI remains approachable for those who want to jump in with simple commands, yet it stays powerful for advanced users who want to customize flows and integrate with external systems.

Images that fit the theme:
- Solana ecosystem imagery and logos to evoke the platform.
- Memecoin symbolism such as coins, rockets, and charts.
- Code and terminal imagery to signal a developer-focused tool.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Key features

- Multidex support on Solana: Access liquidity across all major dexes and aggregator services.
- Plug-in data layers: Bring in price feeds, order book data, and on-chain signals from multiple sources.
- Fast sniping workflows: Rapidly identify and act on favorable on-chain conditions and liquidity events.
- Safe, auditable trades: Logs, traceable transactions, and optional dry-run mode to validate flows before live use.
- Configurable risk controls: Slippage, timeouts, order sizing, and stop conditions can be tuned per strategy.
- Extensible CLI: Clear commands, helpful prompts, and structured outputs that are easy to script.
- Local and remote wallet support: Works with common wallet providers and key management options.
- Testable by design: Built with testability in mind so strategies can be validated in a quiet environment.

Emojis help visualize concepts:
- ðŸ§­ Navigation across DEXes
- âš¡ Lightning-fast order flow
- ðŸ”’ Secure and auditable trades

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported tools and ecosystems

- Solana blockchain as the execution layer
- Jupiter for routing and price discovery
- Helios RPC for fast, reliable RPC access
- Solscan for on-chain insights
- Birdeye and other on-chain data providers
- Sniping workflows and time-sensitive trades
- Phantom and other wallets for signers
- Memecoin themes and liquidity patterns across the Solana ecosystem
- Common data feeds and market data providers (BitQuery, BitScreener-like sources, etc.)
- General dex-agnostic logic that can be extended to new exchanges

The project aims to be practical first. It uses widely adopted formats and services so new contributors can pick up concepts quickly. The focus remains on reliability, clean interfaces, and clear behavior under load.

Note: The topics reflect the landscape of memecoin trading, data feeds, and Solana tooling. They guide what kinds of integrations and examples you might see in documentation, tests, and plugin examples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

How Pumpsploit works

- Data collection: Pumpsploit fetches market data from multiple sources. It combines price quotes, liquidity, and on-chain signals to form a view of opportunity.
- Decision logic: Based on configured strategies, the tool decides when to place orders. It allows both simple rules and more advanced scripting for complex flows.
- Execution: Orders are submitted to the Solana network through adapters that talk to DEX programs. Slippage checks and timeout guards protect against unfavorable fills.
- Feedback and logging: Each step is logged with contextual information. You can replay runs and audit how decisions were made.
- Safety nets: Dry-run modes, transaction dry-run, and canaries provide a way to test without risking funds in production.
- Extensibility: New data sources or dex adapters can be added as modules. The CLI provides hooks for those modules to plug into the workflow.

The design emphasizes clear separation of concerns: data, decisions, and execution each have explicit boundaries. This makes it easier to test, extend, and diagnose issues when they arise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting started

Installation

- Prerequisites:
  - Node.js v18 or newer
  - npm v9 or newer
  - Git
  - A Solana wallet with a funded account for testing (testnet or devnet recommended until you are ready for mainnet)
  - Familiarity with command line workflows and JSON-based configurations

- Quick install options:
  - Global install (recommended for everyday use):
    - npm install -g pumpsploit
  - Local development install:
    - git clone https://github.com/broly907246/pumpsploit.git
    - cd pumpsploit
    - npm install
    - npm link (to make the CLI available as pumpsploit)

First run and configuration

- Basic run:
  - pumpsploit --help
  - pumpsploit init
  - pumpsploit config set network solana-mainnet
- Wallet setup:
  - Pumpsploit expects a signer. You can use a keypair file or a ledger-based signer depending on your setup.
  - Example (local keypair):
    - export PUMPSPLIT_WALLET_KEYPAIR=/path/to/keypair.json
  - Example (ledger/ hardware signer):
    - pumpsploit signer init --type ledger
- Data sources:
  - Enable or disable data providers and DEX adapters via config:
    - pumpsploit config set dataProviders="helius,solscan,bitquery"
    - pumpsploit config set dexAdapters="jupiter,birdeye"
- Network and RPC:
  - Set Solana RPC endpoints:
    - pumpsploit config set rpcUrl="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
  - Use a fast RPC provider to minimize latency.

Direct download note

- The Releases page provides assets for various platforms. If you need to install on another platform, check the Releases page for the appropriate asset and follow the installation guide included in the archive.

Usage guide

Basic commands

- pumpsploit --version
- pumpsploit --help
- pumpsploit init
- pumpsploit config set network solana-mainnet
- pumpsploit config set rpcUrl "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
- pumpsploit signer set --type keypair --path /path/to/keypair.json
- pumpsploit status
- pumpsploit list-dexes
- pumpsploit list-sources
- pumpsploit run --strategy default

Snipe and trade patterns

- Snipe mode:
  - pumpsploit snipe --token BONKFUN --dex jupiter --slippage 1.5 --amount 1000
  - This mode looks for favorable on-chain conditions to buy a memecoin across DEXes with a preconfigured slippage cap.
- Cross-dex routing:
  - pumpsploit route --from-token BONKFUN --to-token MEMECOIN --dexes jupiter,birdeye
  - The router evaluates liquidity and fees across multiple DEX adapters and selects the best execution path.
- Liquidity-aware trading:
  - pumpsploit liquidity-check --token BONKFUN
  - This command estimates immediate liquidity for a given token to avoid over-sizing positions.
- Scheduled trading:
  - pumpsploit schedule --cron "*/5 * * * *" --strategy default
  - Run frequently in small windows to catch micro-arbitrage opportunities.
- Dry-run testing:
  - pumpsploit run --strategy test --dry-run
  - Use this to validate flows without signing live transactions.

Automation and scripting

- Output formats:
  - Pumpsploit emits structured logs in JSON by default. You can redirect to files or pipe into a streaming processor.
- Event hooks:
  - You can attach small JavaScript or TypeScript scripts to respond to different events, such as new price quotes or a completed trade.
- Integration points:
  - The CLI is designed to be called by other scripts or orchestrators. You can trigger it from a larger automation harness or a cron-based system.

Advanced usage patterns

- Portfolio-level strategies:
  - Combine multiple snipe calls to build a diversified memecoin exposure.
- Time-weighted strategies:
  - Implement time-based entry and exit rules to spread risk across short periods.
- Dynamic risk controls:
  - Adapt slippage and max spend based on liquidity observations and historical volatility.
- Data-driven decisions:
  - Use external signals to influence the decision logic. For example, feed a sentiment index or social metrics into your strategy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration and environment

Environment variables and config options
